# Venti5sera

I belong to a huge family with some ancient traditions. One of them is the "Christmas presents chain" in which we do a lottery a couple of months before Christmas to select who will give presents to whom.

For some years I have managed the wishlists via email but it soon became a mess, so I decided to create this
application to let every person manage her own list.

## What does *venti5sera* mean?

In my family we traditionally have the Christmas party in the evening of Dec. 25th, so in
Italian the name *venti5sera* means "the evening of 25th". Well, it actually means *twenty5theevening*.


## Notes for developers

Once cloned, bundle with `bundle --without production` to avoid problems with `pg`.
