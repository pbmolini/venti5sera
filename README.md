# Venti5sera

## Why this application

I have a huge family with some ancient traditions. One of them is the "Christmas presents chain"
in which we do a lottery a couple of months before Christmas to select who will give presents to whom.
I used to manage the wishlists via email but it soon became a mess, so I decided to create this 
application to let every person to manage his own list.

## Beer-ware license

Pietro Molini wrote this code. As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.

## What does *venti5sera* mean?

In my family we traditionally have the Christmas party in the evening of Dec. 25th, so in 
Italian the name *venti5sera* means "the evening of 25th".
